# Batches: the v2 contract

How to create, watch and stop a voice batch staffed by a v2 agent. Reads use
`bland_api_get`; writes use `call_bland_api` (`{method, path, body}`). Do not
write fetch scripts and do not search the docs for these routes.

## Create

`call_bland_api` `POST /v2/batches/create`. Unknown top-level keys are
refused.

| Key | Notes |
|---|---|
| `call_objects` | Array of call bodies, one per recipient. Each needs `phone_number`. |
| `file_id` | An uploaded CSV. Not reachable from here; see [what needs the dashboard](#what-needs-the-dashboard). |
| `global` | Fields every row inherits. Must not contain `phone_number`. |
| `description` | Up to 60 characters. Name the campaign so the user can find it. |
| `status_webhook` | URL that receives lifecycle and completion posts. |
| `column_mapping` | Only with `file_id`. |

One of `call_objects` or `file_id` is required. A 200 returns
`{ batch_id }`. State it in your reply at once.

Synthetic example:

```json
{
  "description": "<campaign name>",
  "global": {
    "agent_id": "00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000000",
    "agent_version": "production",
    "task": "Staffed by the v2 agent.",
    "from": "+15555550199",
    "metadata": { "campaign": "<campaign name>" }
  },
  "call_objects": [
    { "phone_number": "+15555550101", "request_data": { "first_name": "Ana" } },
    { "phone_number": "+15555550102", "request_data": { "first_name": "Ben" } }
  ],
  "status_webhook": "https://example.com/<your endpoint>"
}
```

## The global trap

`global` must carry a fallback: one of `task`, `pathway_id` or `persona_id`.
That check runs before the agent check, so a `global` with only `agent_id`
returns 400 `BATCH_V2_CREATE_VALIDATION_ERROR`. `pathway_id` and
`persona_id` conflict with `agent_id`, so a v2 batch sends `agent_id` **and**
a non-empty `task`. The agent version drives the call; the `task` text is a
placeholder. The dashboard sends one too.

## How a row combines with global

Each row is laid over `global` key by key. A key in the row replaces the
same key in `global` whole: a row's `request_data` replaces the global
`request_data`, it is not merged. Put shared values in `global` and only
per-person values in the row, or repeat the shared keys inside each row's
object.

Do not put `agent_id`, `pathway_id` or `persona_id` in a row. A row that
staffs something else fails at dispatch.

The version rules, `request_data` versus `metadata`, voicemail and webhooks
are the same as for one call: read [calls](calls.md#the-body).

## What happens to rows after create

A 200 with a `batch_id` means the batch was accepted, not that its rows are
good. Rows are checked right after, and the result is in the logs:

- A row with no `phone_number` fails the whole batch.
- A repeated number, an impossible number, or a number on the org's
  do-not-call list is dropped and logged as a validation failure. Numbers are
  compared as written after adding a leading `+`.
- A row `start_time` less than 5 minutes away dials now; more than 28 days
  away, the row is dropped.
- `dispatch_hours` works per row or in `global`, and needs `timezone`;
  without it the window is ignored.
- Every row's call is prepared as the batch starts, so the agent version is
  fixed then, even for rows scheduled later.
- Rows run 1,000 at a time. The next 1,000 start once the previous 1,000 have
  ended. There is no pacing or concurrency setting; spread a list with
  per-row `start_time` or split it.

The full lifecycle, with what each status means, is in
[how it works](how-it-works.md#a-batch).

## Rate-limit pre-flight

The Batches page refuses a batch larger than what is left of the org's
hourly or daily call allowance. Apply the same check before every batch.

1. `bland_api_get` `/user/rateLimits` returns
   `{ hourlyCount, dailyCount, template: { hourly_limit, daily_limit, … } }`.
2. Hourly remaining = `hourly_limit - hourlyCount`. Daily remaining =
   `daily_limit - dailyCount`. The windows are the current UTC clock hour and
   the current UTC day.
3. If the recipient count is greater than either remaining value, **refuse**.
   Quote both numbers you read. Offer to split the list into batches that
   fit, sent after the window resets, or to remove recipients.
4. If the read fails, has no `template`, or answers `oauth_path_not_allowed`,
   do not create the batch. Say the allowance could not be checked and stop.

## DNC pre-flight

Rows on the org's do-not-call list are dropped when the batch validates and
logged as "Number is on your organization's do-not-call list." Check first so
the confirm states the real count.

- Up to about 20 recipients: `call_bland_api` `POST /v1/org_dnc/search` with
  `{ "phone_number": "<E.164>" }` per recipient.
- More: page `bland_api_get` `/v1/org_dnc` with `limit` (up to `1000`) and
  `offset` until you hold `total_count` entries, and compare the
  `entries[].phone_number` values with the list.
- Remove hits from `call_objects`. Report how many were removed, not the
  numbers themselves.
- On an OAuth connection the search route is refused; the list read is
  allowed.

## The canary

Before a full list, recommend a one-row batch with the same `global`, to a
number the user controls. Watch it to a terminal status, read the call with
`get_call_log`, and check that the agent version, caller id, variables and
voicemail behaved. Only then confirm the full list. A canary is a real call
and needs its own confirm.

## Status lifecycle

`batch_status` on the batch row moves through:

`initializing` → `validating` → `dispatching` → `in_progress` →
`in_progress_chunked` (only past 1,000 rows) → `waiting_for_scheduled_calls`
(only when rows were scheduled) → one of `completed`, `completed_partial`,
`failed`.

- A stopped batch ends `failed`; one that waited 24 hours for its calls to end
  ends `completed_partial`.
- `completed` means every queued call ended, not that every call connected.
  `calls_successful` includes no-answer and busy.
- Every terminal status is final. Read the logs for the reason. The diagram is
  in [how it works](how-it-works.md#a-batch).

## status_webhook

Optional URL. The batch posts JSON to it at each lifecycle step and at the
end:

```text
{ batch_id, status, message?, code?, reason?,
  calls_total?, calls_successful?, calls_failed?, timestamp }
```

`status` takes the values above from `validating` on; nothing is posted for
`initializing`. Delivery is best-effort with a 10-second timeout and no retry;
treat it as a signal and read the batch to confirm.

## Read and stop

| Route | Notes |
|---|---|
| `GET /v2/batches/list` | `agent_id` (UUID, optional), `take` (default 10, max 100), `skip`. Newest first. |
| `GET /v2/batches/<batch id>` | The batch row: `batch_status`, `description`, `agent_id`, `created_at`, the stored rows. An unknown id returns `data: null`. |
| `GET /v2/batches/<batch id>/logs` | `take` (default 10, max 100), `skip`, `direction` (`asc` or `desc`, default `desc`). Lifecycle events with reasons. |
| `GET /v1/calls?batch_id=<batch id>` | The batch's calls. For review in bulk, hand off to [call analysis](../../call-analysis/SKILL.md). |
| `POST /v2/batches/<batch id>/stop` | Confirm first. Calls not yet dialed, scheduled rows included, are not placed. Calls already connected run on; stop them one by one with `stop_call`. The batch ends `failed` and cannot be resumed. 400 `BATCH_V2_STOP_ERROR_NOT_FOUND` means already finished, stopped or unknown. |

Poll the batch every 15 to 30 seconds while it dispatches, then less often.

## What needs the dashboard

Say the dashboard path and stop; do not try to work around it.

- **CSV upload.** `file_id` comes from a multipart upload the passthrough
  cannot send. Inline `call_objects` covers the same voice batch.
- **SMS batches.** `POST /v1/sms/batch` requires a `file_id`. Use the
  Batches page.
- **Your own carrier account.** Batch create takes `encrypted_key` from a
  request header. The passthrough cannot set headers and the Batches page has
  no connection option, so send such a batch from the user's own API client,
  or place the calls one at a time (a single call accepts `encrypted_key` in
  the body).

## Errors

| Code | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `BATCH_V2_CREATE_VALIDATION_ERROR` | Body shape, missing `call_objects`/`file_id`, `phone_number` in `global`, no `task` fallback, or a bad `column_mapping`. The message names the field. | Fix that field only. |
| `AGENT_ID_INVALID` | `global.agent_id` is not a UUID. | Read the id again. |
| `AGENT_PARAM_CONFLICT` | `global` mixes `agent_id` with `pathway_id` or `persona_id`. | Keep `agent_id` and `task`. |
| `AGENT_ORG_REQUIRED` | Not an organization key or session. | Do not switch orgs. |
| `AGENT_NOT_FOUND` | No such agent in this org. | Check the org and the id. |
| `BATCH_V2_CREATE_ERROR` (500) or a timeout | The batch may exist. Create is not idempotent: a resend makes a second batch. | Read `/v2/batches/list` and look for the description before sending again. |

Version problems such as `AGENT_ENV_UNPINNED` are not caught at create. They
fail every row at dispatch, which is one more reason for the canary.
