# Messaging: texts on a bound number

SMS, iMessage, RCS and WhatsApp threads run on a number bound to the agent.
The number's own settings are live and not versioned. What the agent says is
owned by the agent's production version.

## Which number

1. On the Messages page, `phoneNumber` in the URL search is the number.
2. Otherwise `bland_api_get` `/v2/agents/<agent id>/inbound`: `numbers` are
   the bound numbers, `pathway_id` is the agent's compiled pathway (used to
   scope threads below).
3. `GET /v1/messaging/numbers` lists the org's messaging-capable numbers with
   the `agent_id` each serves.

Attaching or moving a number belongs to the phone-numbers skill.

## Number settings

`POST /v1/sms/number/update` with `{phone_number, channel, ...fields}`.
`channel` is `sms` (default), `whatsapp` or `imessage`. A number on the
iMessage provider is saved as `imessage` even when `sms` is sent.

Read first: `bland_api_get` `/v1/sms/numbers?channel=<channel>` returns the
numbers with a row for that channel, and the row.

The write takes effect at once, in every environment. It is not versioned
and promote does not touch it. Send only the fields that change; the others
keep their values.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `webhook` | URL for message and status events on this number. |
| `time_out` | Idle seconds before a thread ends. A positive value under 30 is raised to 30. `0` or `null` turns it off. |
| `warning_time`, `warning_message` | Reminder before the end. `warning_time` must be less than `time_out`, else 400. |
| `timeout_message` | Sent when the thread ends on idle. |
| `request_data` | Variables every thread on this number starts with. |
| `messaging_service_sid` | Bring-your-own-carrier numbers only. Saving it starts a registration with the carrier service. Confirm it with the user character by character. |

On a number bound to a v2 agent, the prompt, objective, pathway, tools and
temperature fields are ignored: the agent version wins. Change the agent,
never the number.

Errors: 400 `INVALID_CHANNEL`, 400 `PHONE_NUMBER_REQUIRED`, 404
`INBOUND_NUMBER_NOT_FOUND`, 403 `ENTERPRISE_REQUIRED`.

## WhatsApp

WhatsApp is for enterprise orgs with WhatsApp access. When the Messages page
shows no WhatsApp option, the org does not have it; say so and stop.

A number is set up for WhatsApp exactly when it appears in
`/v1/sms/numbers?channel=whatsapp`. Configure it with the same update and
`"channel": "whatsapp"`: `webhook`, `time_out`, `request_data`. WhatsApp has
no SMS fallback.

## A2P registration

US texting from a standard long code needs an A2P 10DLC brand and campaign.

- Status: `bland_api_get` `/v1/messaging/a2p`. It returns the stored
  registration and, when available, `brand_live_status` from the carrier
  registry. **This is the status to report.** The card on the Messages page
  is kept in the browser and can read approved before the carrier decides.
- Draft: POST `/v1/messaging/a2p/register` with `brand`, `campaign` and
  `linked_number_ids` and **no** `brandDetails` saves the form only.
- Submit: the same POST with `brandDetails` registers the brand with the
  carrier registry, and the campaign when `campaign` is present. It needs
  `brandDetails.businessName` and `brandDetails.ein` (else 400). Vetting takes
  days, carries fees and cannot be withdrawn here. Use the REQUIRED confirm.
- Never submit twice. After any error, read the status first. A stored
  `brand.registration_sid` means a brand exists; a second submit registers a
  duplicate.
- Use `/v1/messaging/a2p` only, not the older `/v1/sms/a2p/*` routes.

## Read threads

`bland_api_get` `/v1/sms/conversations` with:

- `filters`: a JSON array string of `{field, operator, value}`. Operators
  include `equals`, `not`, `in`, `notIn`, `contains`, `gt`, `lt`.
- `mode`: `AND` (default) or `OR`. It applies to every filter, so keep `AND`
  when one filter is a scope.
- `limit` (up to 1000), `from`, `sort_by` (`created_at`, `updated_at`,
  `last_message_at`, `message_count`), `ascending`.

Scopes:

| Want | Filter |
|---|---|
| This agent | `curr_pathway_id` `equals` the `pathway_id` from `/v2/agents/<agent id>/inbound` |
| iMessage, WhatsApp | `channel` `equals` `IMESSAGE` or `WHATSAPP` |
| SMS only | `channel` `equals` `SMS` and `effective_channel` `not` `api_chat` |
| RCS, API chat | `effective_channel` `equals` `rcs` or `api_chat` |

One thread: `GET /v1/sms/conversations/<id>` returns the messages with
`sender` and delivery `status`. Its webhook log:
`GET /v1/sms/conversations/<id>/webhook`.

## Send, take over, hand back

All of these text a real person. Use the REQUIRED confirm and quote the from
number, the recipient and the exact text. All need an enterprise plan (403
`ENTERPRISE_REQUIRED`). They apply to text threads; an API chat thread is
answered through the customer's app.

| Step | Route | Body |
|---|---|---|
| Take over | `POST /v1/sms/conversations/<id>/handoff` | `{reason?, metadata?, webhook?, notify_number?, actor?}`. The agent stops replying. `notify_number` gets a text too. |
| Reply as a person | `POST /v1/sms/conversations/<id>/messages` | `{"message": "<text>", "sender": "HUMAN"}`, at most 1,600 characters, header `Idempotency-Key`. 202 `{status: "processing", message_id, human_handoff_active}`. |
| Hand back | `POST /v1/sms/conversations/<id>/resume` | `{node_id?, message?, generate_reply?, actor?}`. `message` is sent as the agent; `generate_reply: true` has the agent write one. Not both (400). With neither, nothing is sent. |
| Close | `POST /v1/sms/conversations/<id>/end` | `{reason?, actor?}` |

Take over before replying, so the agent does not answer over the person.

Start a new thread: `POST /v1/sms/send` with `user_number`, `agent_number`
(the bound number) and optionally `agent_message`, `request_data`,
`metadata`, `webhook`, `new_conversation`. The agent then answers replies on
its own. Leave out the pathway and persona overrides so the bound agent
answers.

`POST /v1/sms/trigger` with `{user_number, agent_number, user_message}`
injects a customer message and **texts the agent's reply to `user_number`**.
Use it only with a number the user owns, as a live test.

A text to many people is a batch: build the list with
[analytics-cohorts](../../analytics-cohorts/SKILL.md), then create the batch
on `/dashboard/batches`. Never loop `/v1/sms/send`.

## How a text turn runs

Texts run the agent's compiled production version, refreshed on attach and on
each promote. A publish to staging does not reach texts.

`settings.messaging.mode` picks the runtime for texts and API chat (not voice,
not web chat):

- `reasoning` (the default when absent): the turn reads a **brief** compiled
  from the agent. `bland_api_get`
  `/v2/agents/<agent id>/brief?channel=<sms|imessage|rcs|whatsapp>&version=<semver>`
  returns `{version_id, brief}`; omit `version` for the dev head.
- If `brief.pathwayOnly` lists anything (webhook, code or scheduling steps,
  tool chains, verification), that channel runs the pathway node by node
  instead.
- `pathway`: always node by node, as voice does.

So a text can behave differently from a voice call on the same version. Read
the brief before blaming the graph.

## Why a channel is silent

Check in order; stop at the first failure.

1. **Bound?** The number is in `/v2/agents/<agent id>/inbound` `numbers`.
2. **Promoted?** The behaviour the user expects is in production, not only on
   dev or staging.
3. **Thread state.** `GET /v1/sms/conversations/<id>`: a thread in handoff
   gets no agent replies until resumed; an ended or timed-out thread is
   closed.
4. **Delivery.** Outbound messages with a failed `status`: for US SMS read
   the A2P status.
5. **Runtime.** Read the brief as above when replies are wrong rather than
   missing.

Web chat: the widget is published (`allowed_domains` not empty), the site's
host is listed, and it is bound. API chat: 403 `CHANNEL_DISABLED` means the
production snapshot has `settings.apiChat.enabled` off.

## Display-only and destructive

- `PATCH /v1/messaging/<phone>/settings` with `primary_channel` and
  `delivery_order` (the "channel priority" on the Messages page) is stored
  but nothing reads it. It does not change which channel a text uses. Say so
  rather than setting it.
- `PATCH /v1/sms/conversations/<id>` `{is_active}` closes or reopens a thread.
- `DELETE /v1/sms/conversations/<id>/messages` `{message_ids: [...]}` and
  `DELETE /v1/sms/conversations/<id>` delete history and cannot be undone.
  Use the REQUIRED confirm.
