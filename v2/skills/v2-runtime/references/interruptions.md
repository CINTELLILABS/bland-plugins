# Interruptions: audio is not routing

Use “interruption” with a qualifier. Stopping audible speech, changing scenario,
and selecting a global node are different mechanisms with different evidence.

| Mechanism | What changes | Inspect | Does not imply |
|---|---|---|---|
| Audio barge-in | Whether/how caller speech cuts off agent playback | Calls → Conversation feel, effective call settings, audio/playback evidence | A different node or scenario was selected |
| Scenario/topic change | Which conversation flow handles the caller's next intent | Entry criteria, explicit and generated routes, flow boundary, current variables and selected route | Agent audio was immediately cut off |
| Global-node interruption | A router-selected global step handles an intent, with its configured continuation | `settings.global`, loop conditions, return mode and trace | Every utterance or every moment can bypass every gate |

## Audio settings: use the current scope

In the current v2 builder, audio controls are call-level settings under Calls →
Conversation feel. Snapshot fields include `settings.blockInterruptions`,
`settings.interruptibility`, `settings.interruptionSensitivity`,
`settings.agentBackchannelLevel`, `settings.agentBackchannelConfig`, and
`settings.backgroundNoise`. Inspect current schema/defaults and the actual
resolved call settings before changing an unfamiliar value.

- Blocking interruptions is a distinct setting, not a routing hold.
- Interruptibility levels configure how readily callers can cut in; they are
  not durations in milliseconds. A threshold is not a measured latency either.
- Backchannels are short acknowledgments, not necessarily full agent turns or
  transitions. Test them separately from barge-in and end-of-turn detection.
- Older snapshots can retain per-step `settings.advanced.interruptibility`,
  `blockInterruptions`, `interruptionThreshold`, `agentBackchannelLevel`,
  `agentBackchannelConfig`, and `backgroundTrack`. The current v2 compiler does
  not emit those per-node audio overrides. Editing them can change the JSON
  without changing the call or exposing any matching control in the builder.
- On an older deployment, verify the actual supported scope. Do not invent an
  override based solely on a field's presence in historical JSON.

To prove a cutoff, use actual playback instrumentation or aligned recorded audio,
not a transcript or an empty SDK queue. For runner timing, adaptive callers,
latency accounting, and recovery cases read [voice evidence](../../v2-testing/references/voice.md).

## Scenario/topic changes

The caller's new intent is a routing question. Inspect the current component,
its exit/continuation, and the destination's entry criteria. The current mapping
can route directly between eligible root siblings; do not require a hub hop
or add one merely to match an older mental model. See
[builder/runtime mapping](builder-runtime-map.md).

Within a rigid nested flow, ordinary steps follow that flow's routing. A broad
entry description does not prove every inner step has a cross-scenario escape.
A self-loop, `loopWhile`, deterministic route, global route, and a component
exit have different roles. Inspect the decision trace instead of guessing that
a caller topic change must immediately leave the current step.

## Global-node routing and return

Step-level globals exist. Their label/description supplies router eligibility;
the builder can show a Global badge without drawing incoming lines everywhere.

| `settings.global.returnMode` | Continuation |
|---|---|
| `previous` | Automatic return behavior to the interrupted node |
| `redirect` with `forwardingNode` | Redirect to the configured target; that target supplies the response |
| `manual` | Auto-return disabled; authored onward routes stay relevant, with optional labelled return |

On executable steps, `settings.advanced.conditionOverridesGlobalPathway` lets
an unmet loop/goal hold prevent the usual global-node diversion. It is not the
audio “block interruptions” switch. Without that hold, a selected global can
interrupt an unfinished step when the runtime's other eligibility conditions
permit. After-run actions and verification gates can also affect the result;
do not present one simplified priority list as every execution branch.

The current compiler retains step-level flow controls such as `skipUserResponse`
and this loop/global option, but ignores those old advanced flow controls on
hub/scenario cards. Stored JSON presence does not prove activation at that scope.

## Diagnostic examples

### Repetition after barge-in is not a diagnosis

An early interruption can regenerate the response on the current node. Recovery
also avoids replaying a previous tool, code, router, transfer, or other action
step. Neither outcome alone proves a broken route, missed transcription, or
noise-cancellation problem. Other recovery paths can revisit a previous node;
do not promise a universal rewind rule.

Before changing settings, align the caller audio and agent playback with the
accepted caller text, interruption/recovery events (when exposed), current and
previous nodes, chosen next node, variables, and tool results. Distinguish:

- Playback stopped, accepted text is correct, response regenerated on the same
  node: inspect recovery and loop/verification state before changing audio.
- Caller speech is audible but absent from accepted text: investigate the input
  path; this still does not identify which setting caused the loss.
- Correct caller text but unexpected next node: inspect routing evidence and
  gates, not just audio sensitivity.

If recovery details are unavailable, state that limit. A controlled comparison
on the same version and fixture can test a hypothesis; do not diagnose noise
cancellation from repetition or transcript evidence alone.

### Other symptoms

- **“It stopped talking but stayed on the same question.”** Check audio cutoff
  separately from node/variable progress. Barge-in can work without a route change.
- **“Help has no incoming arrow but it answered.”** Inspect global matching and
  return mode before adding ordinary edges.
- **“I changed a node's interruption threshold and nothing happened.”** Verify
  whether it is a retired per-node field; edit the active call-level control.
- **“I asked for another department but it stayed.”** Check loop state, actual
  available routes, entry criteria, and verification requirements—not audio
  sensitivity. A text test can investigate routing; voice evidence proves sound.
