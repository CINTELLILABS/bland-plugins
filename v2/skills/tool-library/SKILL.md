# Tools, secrets and connections

A library tool is an org row agents call mid-conversation. Answer "how does
it work" and "why did it happen" from [how tools work](references/how-it-works.md).
Read the [tool library reference](../v2-runtime/references/tool-library.md)
before the first write; steps are in [procedures](references/workflows.md).
Attaching edits a snapshot ([v2-snapshot](../v2-snapshot/SKILL.md)); test
chats follow [v2-testing](../v2-testing/SKILL.md). Do not write fetch scripts
or search the docs for these routes.

## Page context

Call `get_dashboard_page_context` (`mode: "synced"`) first. No target chip
exists here.

- `/dashboard/tools`, `/dashboard/tools/create`: org scope.
- `/dashboard/tools/$toolId`: tool id.
- `/dashboard/tools/secrets`, `/connections`: lists; `/resources/$resourceId`.
- `/dashboard/agent/$agentId/tools/**`: agent id, plus tool id on `$toolId`.

Mutate through the API, never the page's forms. After every write say:
"Saved through the API. The page shows it after a refresh."

## Workflow: create and prove a tool

Budget: search, create, run, one test-chat turn, attach save.

1. `bland_api_get` `/v1/tools?search=<name>`; reuse a match.
2. Write the definition per the reference: no top-level `url` or `method` on
   an integration definition, and an object `input_schema`. Both save
   cleanly, then fail every call with HTTP 0.
3. `call_bland_api` POST `/v2/tools`. Keep the id.
4. POST `/v2/tools/<id>/run` with `{"inputs": {…}}`, synthetic values.
5. One test-chat turn that makes the agent call it.
6. Attach and say why this mode: embedded copy (frozen, this agent),
   `byReference` or a `tool` step (both follow library edits).

Custom code: `save_code_snippet`, then the tool pinned to the returned
version ([custom code tools](references/workflows.md#custom-code-tools)).

## Workflow: change a shared tool safely

Budget: read, agent scan, write, read-back, run.

1. `bland_api_get` `/v1/tools/<id>`. Keep the original.
2. Run the [consumer scan](references/workflows.md#consumer-scan).
3. Show the diff and the affected agents. Confirm.
4. POST `/v2/tools/<id>` with only the changed keys. Never send a partial
   body to POST `/v1/tools/<id>`: it replaces the row unvalidated.
5. Read back, then `/run`.

## Workflow: debug a tool run

Budget: one log read for the call, one stats read, one definition read.

1. `bland_api_get` `/v2/tools/logs?call_id=<call id>`, or by `tool_id` (raw
   UUID) with `status=error`.
2. `/v2/tools/logs/stats?tool_id=<uuid>&group_by=error_type&status=error&period=week`.
3. Name one cause from the [cause table](references/workflows.md#debug-a-tool-run)
   with the row (or its absence) as evidence. Change something before any
   re-run.

## Workflow: delete a tool safely

Budget: read, consumer scan, one stats read, one delete.

1. `bland_api_get` `/v1/tools/<id>`; run the
   [consumer scan](references/workflows.md#consumer-scan).
2. Name every agent and node; offer to detach first.
3. Confirm, then DELETE `/v2/tools/<uuid>`. There is no reference check.

## Secrets and connections

- `/v1/secrets` first; prefer the user entering the value on Tools, Secrets.
  Reference by id: `{{secret.id.<secret id>}}`. Delete is UI-only.
- Connect: POST `/v1/integrations/<key>/connect` `{"name": "<label>"}`, hand
  over `connect_link`, poll `/v1/resources?integration=<key>`.
- Before a disconnect or DELETE `/v1/resources/<id>`, list the `/v1/tools`
  rows with that `resource_id`: they deactivate. Reconnect is UI-only.

## Confirm before

Any shared-tool write or delete, a snippet save that unpinned consumers run,
any disconnect:

```text
About to <verb> <object>: <what changes, which agents or tools are affected>.
This <changes live calls now | deactivates N tools | cannot be undone>.
Reply "yes" to proceed.
```

## Refusals and limits

- `oauth_path_not_allowed`: say "this connection cannot reach tools; do it
  on /dashboard/tools" and stop.
- `INVALID_TOOL_TYPE` from POST `/v2/tools/<id>`: a legacy tool. After the
  confirm, POST the full original with the change, including
  `staging_tool`, to `/v1/tools/<id>`.
- Redact tool headers. Never call the dashboard's connection sign-in routes or
  `/v2/tools/suggestions`. `/run`, `/v1/tools/run` and
  `/v1/resources/<id>/execute` are real executions, not reads.
