# Norm product wiki

Start with the row matching the task. Open that reference, not every file in
this index. Local references explain behavior; the connected tool schema and
current official API documentation determine the request that can be sent.

For the complete navigation/coverage map, including all node families,
dispositions, external resources and operational surfaces, read the
[v2 surface map](surface-map.md).

## How each feature works

Open the matching page when the question is "how does X work" or "why did X
happen". Each explains the objects, their states, how the feature reaches a
live call or conversation, what the dashboard shows, the limits, and a cause
map.

| Feature | How it works |
|---|---|
| A v2 call from connect to hang-up: version, opening, per-turn routing, globals, interruptions, setting scopes, canvas versus runtime | [Runtime](../../v2-runtime/references/how-it-works.md) |
| Which version answers and why a change did not take: environments, pins, variables, checks, branches, rollouts | [Environments](../../agent-environments/references/how-it-works.md) |
| How voice and language are chosen for each call | [Voices](../../v2-lifecycle/references/voices.md#how-voice-and-language-work) |
| From a ring to the agent picking up: number ownership, caller screening, caller ID, SIP | [Phone numbers](../../phone-numbers/references/how-it-works.md) |
| From an uploaded source to the answer a caller hears; open questions; agent memory | [Knowledge](../../knowledge-sources/references/how-it-works.md) |
| How a tool call runs mid-conversation, what the caller hears, why it failed | [Tools](../../tool-library/references/how-it-works.md) |
| Which version answers texts, web chat and API chat; session lifetime; why a channel is silent | [Channels](../../agent-channels/references/how-it-works.md) |
| Why a call or batch behaved as it did: version, voicemail, statuses, batch states | [Outbound calls](../../outbound-calls/references/how-it-works.md) |
| Why an automation, alert or post-call webhook fired, failed or did not fire | [Automations](../../automations/references/how-it-works.md) |
| Post-call outputs: which calls are scored, which version, when results arrive, where they go | [Dispositions](../../dispositions/references/how-it-works.md) |
| Judges, eval runs, verdicts, scores, PARTIAL, verdict tags | [Evaluations](../../evaluations/references/how-it-works.md) |
| What a simulation, test chat, browser voice test or phone test actually runs | [Agent testing](../../v2-testing/references/how-it-works.md) |
| How a call becomes a Sankey path; why today's calls are not on the chart | [Analytics Sankey](../../analytics-authoring/references/how-it-works.md) |
| Why a call is missing from analytics; how fresh tiles, cohorts and metrics are | [Cohorts and metrics](../../analytics-cohorts/references/how-it-works.md) |
| What evidence a call leaves and when each piece appears | [Call evidence](../../call-analysis/references/how-it-works.md) |
| How an issue moves from filed to closed | [Issues](../../triage-issues/references/how-it-works.md) |

## What this package is—and is not

- Customer-facing product semantics, task procedures, and API navigation.
- No private platform source, runtime credentials, or production data is needed
  to use these references.
- Not a complete offline copy of every API schema. For an option or endpoint
  not documented here, retrieve the official contract through the docs tools.
- Not an authorization system. The connected API and host enforce access.
- Not an automatic file synchronizer. See the workspace reference before saving.
- Not proof that a capability is enabled for this account. A documented feature
  can still be unavailable; surface that limitation rather than inventing it.
