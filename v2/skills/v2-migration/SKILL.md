description: The hand-migration doctrine for converting a Bland v1 pathway or persona (raw JSON export) into a v2 agent snapshot — architecture rules, verbatim-carriage discipline, the full trap catalog, and the verification bar. Use whenever migrating or converting v1 pathways/personas to v2 agents, or when a migrated agent misbehaves. The /norm:migrate command drives this skill end to end.

# Migrating v1 Pathways and Personas to v2 Agents

Hand-architected conversion beats automatic converters: a human-quality architecture (which nodes form which scenarios, what the hub says, what each entry means) plus **mechanical, verbatim carriage of every byte of content**. This skill is the doctrine; `references/traps.md` is the accumulated trap catalog — read it in full before authoring, and again before pushing.

**Everything is additive.** The v1 pathway keeps serving live traffic untouched. The migration produces a new agent version in the owning org; number cutover is a separate, explicitly-human decision and is NOT part of this skill.

## Inputs (raw JSON, read-only)

- The v1 pathway export: `{name, description, nodes[], edges[]}` — node types Default, Route, Webhook, Custom Code, Custom Tool, Transfer Call, SMS, Knowledge Base, End Call, plus a synthetic `global-prompt` node (no type/data/position — guard every walker).
- For persona migrations: the persona config — `personality_prompt`, `pathway_conditions[] {name, prompt, pathway_id, start_node_id, pathway_version}`, `call_config` — plus each attached pathway's export.
- Treat every v1 resource as **read-only and live**: exported secrets are real credentials (never print them; flag rotation), webhooks point at real systems, transfer numbers dial real people.

## The mapping

| v1 | v2 |
|---|---|
| globalPrompt / persona `personality_prompt` | `settings.systemPrompt` VERBATIM (persona: + each pathway's globalPrompt as clearly-scoped sections) |
| triage node / persona (greets + triages) | The hub. Persona-style sources ARE the natural entry (no re-point); a pre-speech code chain instead needs a silent bootstrap scenario + inbound-edge re-point |
| functional region of nodes | one complex scenario; the region's entry conditions become `entry.description` VERBATIM (persona: `pathway_conditions[].prompt` verbatim) |
| Route node | `route` step: one v2 rule per FLAT v1 condition row (flat rows are OR), one rule per `isGroup` block (AND inside); `fallbackNodeId` from the v1 source |
| Custom Code node | `customCode` step: same `snippet_id`/`snippet_version` pin + `snippet_variables` |
| Attached tool `type:"code"` | NOT expressible as a tool — code step (same pin, explicit input map) + route step carrying the tool's responsePathways. See traps. |
| Webhook node | webhook step (carry url/method/headers/body/responsePathways/response mappings verbatim) |
| In-flow End Call | wrap-up prompt step + exit; 2–3 root `end-call` nodes total ("goodbye" + "silent") |
| Global nodes | hub-routable scenario or system-prompt rule (auto-return globals); documented delta |
| Node-scoped KB | knowledge step with node-scoped kbIds. Lift to agent-level knowledge ONLY if v1 semantics were call-wide — a wrong lift bleeds KB content into scripted steps |

## The procedure (one-shot bar)

1. **Discover.** Census the export (node types, orphans, dangling ids). Produce two artifacts: a functional region map (every node in exactly one region, with entries/exits/route conditions) and an integration catalog (webhooks + auth, snippets + pinned versions, transfers, SMS, KBs, terminals, secrets). Derive the request-data contract: every variable consumed but never produced.
2. **Architect.** Regions → scenarios; hub prompt (spliced verbatim from the v1 triage content, or persona prompt); entry descriptions verbatim from source conditions; end-call roots; every legacy node gets exactly one disposition (carried / synthesized / folded / dropped-with-reason).
3. **Author.** Build the snapshot per the `v2-snapshot` skill. Carriage is programmatic — scripts copy content from source JSON into the snapshot; never retype prose. Namespace node ids if merging multiple source graphs (shared raw ids are common).
4. **Audit.** Run `/norm:validate` — every check must pass. Non-negotiables: no OR-collapse, no null fallbacks the source didn't have, one exit edge per intent, every snippet/tool pin present in the final JSON (grep for each id), no unauthorized KB lift, hub rules scoped.
5. **Push.** `POST /v2/agents/:id/versions` into the OWNING org (org-scoping!). Server-side validation failures are authoring bugs.
6. **Verify.** `/norm:simulate` — a sim suite of roughly one scenario per terminal/lane, judged on outcomes, graded on ENGINE TRACES not judge prose; 3 reps on any flapper; harness artifacts (broken tester personas, unresolved clock vars, expectations contradicting v1's own topology) get fixed in the harness, never in the agent. Then targeted test-chat probes for mechanics.
7. **Report.** Dispositions, documented deltas, carried v1 defects (bug-for-bug is correct — note them, don't fix them), request-data contract, and the honest list of lanes that could NOT be exercised (e.g. CRM-found paths without a customer test record, write-side integrations) — those need the customer's participation, say so plainly.

## Red flags — stop and re-verify

- Diagnosing behavior from judge text or transcripts alone: get the engine's per-turn decision trace first.
- Any content you typed rather than copied.
- "Attach the number to try it" — cutover is one-way; never attach during migration work.
- Testing flows that fire real side effects (gate-opening snippets, CRM writes, schedulers, live transfer lines) without an explicit safety plan: synthetic caller data, personas that stop short of write branches, customer sign-off for one coordinated smoke.
- A sim lane that passes because it never reached the code you changed — check the trace shows the lane you think you tested.
